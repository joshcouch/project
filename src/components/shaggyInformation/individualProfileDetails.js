"about": "When I'm not cracking cases with my four-legged bestie or munching on a giant sandwich, you can find me jamming to some psychedelic tunes. I'm all about good vibes, mystery-solving, and searching for the ultimate snack. Looking for someone who can appreciate a good ghost story and won't mind sharing a Scooby Snack.",
"job": "Professional Sleuth and Part-time Snack Connoisseur. Oh, and I sometimes chase ghosts and unmask villains. It's all in a day's work for a member of the Mystery Inc. crew.",
"company": "Mystery Incorporated - We drive around in a groovy van solving mysteries. It's not your average 9 to 5, but when you get to work with your best buds, every day is a wild adventure.",
"education": "Graduate of the School of Hard Knocks, with a major in Paranormal Investigations and a minor in Snackology. My education mainly comes from the open road, a haunted mansion, or the occasional alien planet. Traditional school? Nah, the world is my classroom.",
